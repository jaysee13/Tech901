                <p>I want to take this course so that i can be able to create websites and hopefully find a career in this industry. I already enjoy working on computers and being able to work on a task for hours, so I feel that i would be of good use.</p></br>
                <p>If I had a super power, I think it would be to fly so that I could get to different places easier and quicker. What would your super power be?</p>
